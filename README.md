# RuneLite-Chat-Filter-Regex
This is my current setup for RuneLite's chat filter plugin.
To set up, simply copy the 'Filtered regex' file and paste it into 'Filtered regex' the config.
Also make sure you have 'Strip accents' checked in the config, otherwise this list will miss most spam.

My goal is to filter out all spam messages from bots while keeping as many real players' messages as possible.
I don't spend too much time at the GE so please message me with a copy of any spam that isn't caught and any real messages that're accidentally filtered out.
Thank you.
