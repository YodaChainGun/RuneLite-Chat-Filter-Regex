# RuneLite-Chat-Filter-Regex
This is my current setup for RuneLite's chat filter plugin under "Filtered regex" in the config.
My goal is to filter out all spam messages from bots while keeping as many real players' messages as possible.
I don't spend too much time at the GE so please message me with a copy of any spam that isn't caught and any real message that's accidentally filtered out.
Thank you.
